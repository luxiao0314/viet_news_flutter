  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - json/TaskResponse.json
    - json/ContentListResponse.json
    - images/ic_task_rank_bg.png
    - images/ic_find_select.png
    - images/ic_find_unselect.png
    - images/ic_follow_select.png
    - images/ic_follow_unselect.png
    - images/ic_mine_select.png
    - images/ic_mine_unselect.png
    - images/ic_task_select.png
    - images/ic_task_unselect.png
    - images/ic_temp_find.jpg
    - images/ic_content_list_like.png
    - images/ic_content_list_collection.png
    - images/ic_content_list_coin.png
    - images/ic_pencil.svg
    - images/ic_default_article.png
    - images/ic_error_article.png
    - images/ic_delete_channel.png

    - images/ic_temp_default_header.jpeg
    - images/ic_userinfo_coin.png

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
